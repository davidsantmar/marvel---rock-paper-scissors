A simple rock, paper, scissors game Avengers based. My first version was built using HTML, CSS and JS and this it's developed with REACT.
Components tested with Jest.

Just click on the rock, paper or scissors character and the system will random an enemy character to battle with you.
The first to arrive to 5 victories will win the battle!
